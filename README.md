Hello. This is my first webapp project created on Flask. It fetches current weather conditions of any city. 

Even though this was a python course. I did use CSS and html to create the webpages and give them a custom style. 

API used from openweatherdata. 

This is part of Python Full Course for Beginners by Dave Gray and freeCodeCamp. I did it as part of my learning and final lesson.
